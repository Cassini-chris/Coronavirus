# Coronavirus

This repo holds the code for a project regarding the visual exploration of the coronavirus using Processing (programming language).

#### The project is for educational purposes: 
- Vizualizing the base-pairs of two Betacoronaviruses
- Betacoronaviruses can cause the common cold of lineage A, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes the disease COVID-19) of lineage B and MERS-CoV of lineage C
- This repo holds the code for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

#### How does the visualization work?
- SARS-CoV holds 29751 base pairs 
- SARS-CoV-2 holds 29903 base pairs
- Based on the sequence of the nucleobases we draw a pixel in a predifined direction.
